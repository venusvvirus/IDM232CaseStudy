        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
        This website serves as a recipe database for meals posted onto the Instagram handle, 
        @tsunam.eats. The owners of @tsunam.eats requested the website have a strong sense of 
        brand imaging, playing homage to the platform’s name.  They wanted the overall design 
        to reflect sophisticated elegance. Since their instagram account only posts pictures 
        and the names of the meals they make, having a website linked to their bio where 
        followers can find the full recipes for each post would boost user interaction. 
        It also attracts other visitors to the site that may not use Instagram to find 
        food recipes. Another component the client requested was the ability to select 
        categories and filters for the recipe pages. This adds convenience for those with 
        dietary restrictions or those looking for meals that take the least amount of time
        to make.

        <h2>Context & Challenge</h2>
        <p>
            @tsunam.eats is an Instagram account founded in 2024. It was created by a Drexel 
            University couple, Saffron Buscemi and Kunaal Krishnan. Since it’s establishment, 
            it has amassed over 3,000 views each month and has gained a loyal follower base.
             Much of the feedback they get from followers is to have access the full recipes 
             for each post. By creating a website for this, recipes can be more personalized 
             to fit the needs/desires of users. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Our development team (me) was given 11 weeks to create this website. It had to use 
            PHP as its primary language and a MySQL database to store each of the recipes used. 
            Another requirement was it had to be hosted both locally and publicly. The hero image 
            for each page also had to incorporate two people eating with The Great Wave painting 
            shown in the back. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The overarching goal of the project was to create a cohesive recipe website that properly
            reflected the story behind @tsunam.eats and was an easy, efficient way to browse various
            recipes.

    <h2>Process & Insight</h2>
    <p>
        Moodboard: I began by creating a moodboard based on existing recipe website designs. I specifically
        appreciated examples that reflected bright color palettes and displayed cook time and ingredient 
        list at the top of the recipe pages.  
    </p>

      <h2></h2>
        <p>
        Home Page: A main design inspiration I wanted to incorporate into the home page is this trio of plates
        shown below. I began by incorporating it following the hero image. I initially gave it a ‘beachy vibe’,
        as I thought it best reflected the introductory pun (“Wave Hello to Your Next Favorite Meal”) welcoming
        the user to the site. However, after receiving user feedback, I decided to make the design compliment 
        the hero image more by using darker colors for a higher contrast and fonts that provided a more 
        sophisticated, less youthful look. These plates also acted as navigation buttons to each of the main 
        pages of the website. The end result allowed the design to feel more high end, as it it was for a fancy 
        restaurant.

        About Page: For the about page, I provided the story behind the Instagram account. I ensured 
        it felt like a personal note written by the couple, reflected through their signage at the end. 
        I again had to change a lot of design elements  of the initial iteration to make it appear more 
        professional and cohesive with the top of the screen. While the finalized design used blue text 
        throughout the page, once I began coding I decided to just keep the Instagram handle name in this 
        color to provide an extra pop but allow the rest of the text to be more legible.

        Recipes Page: For the recipes page, it was important for each recipe to have a picture to show what 
        the finished meal will look like. It was also important for users to know how long each recipe took 
        to make, without having to click on it. These were key design elements I incorporated, along with  
        the filter and category options. To the right of these features is also the ability to see what filters
        or categories have been selected. I used the MySQL database to properly filter results based on what is 
        selected for them.

        <p>
        Individual Recipe Pages: Once a recipe was selected from the recipes page, the user would be directed to that 
        specific recipe page. It was crucial for the design and layout of these pages to be consistent for each recipe. 
        I used MySQL to help with structuring the steps and images used for each.  I made sure each page had a back 
        button at the top, followed with an expanded main image. Following the title would be key elements of the recipe, 
        including total time to cook and number of ingredients. A small description of the recipe followed. I wanted to 
        ensure these pages were similar to standard layouts of online recipes. I then used a picture of all the ingredients 
        above the bullet point list to make it easier to visualize.

        <h2></h2>
        <p>
        Following the list of ingredients would then be the instructions for the recipe. These instructions where broken down 
        into steps, which were accompanied with images, respectively. At the end of the last step, I made sure to include a back 
        button, so the user had the option to get back to the top of the page without having to scroll.

        Contact Page: The final page of this website is the contact page. This allows user to join the site’s newsletter and even 
        send messages to Saffron and Kunaal, whether for inquiries, feedback, recipe requests, or collaborations.  This page is simple, 
        offering the ability to subscribe and write something to the owners at the same time. Once the form is submitted, a thank you 
        message appears on the screen, as well as the ability to return back to the original contact page.

        The completed website proved to be a success. While some of the recipe images tend to lag when loading, they have been optimized 
        to reduce this. I ensured the website fit the brand of Tsunam Eats, told a story, was visually appealing, and easy to use. 
        Completely changing the design of the initial design layout proved to be a great choice, as the website is left looking cohesive 
        bottom to top.

          <h2>The Results</h2>
          <p>
            Since the launch of their website, Saffron and Kunaal have seen a rise in visitors on their Instagram page. The contact page 
            proved to be a great addition, as many followers use it to submit requests for meals and stay more connected with the channel. 
            It has even led followers to recreate meals and post them, now that they can finally follow along with each recipe. 
            User testing also showed that the overall design of the website it rated highly, as it has a unique look to it but still 
            uses standard formatting of recipe websites.
